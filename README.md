# EnviormentalScience-PopulationCalculator Written for Node.js 
## This program helps calculate certain AP Enviormental Science population questions
1) **Birth/Death Rate**
2) **Birth/Death Rate Per Thousand**
3) **Population Growth Rate**
4) **Population Growth Rate Per Thousand**
5) **Doubling Time**

Essentially, you will choose one of the five above questions that pertain to the most common Env Sci.
The program will then ask you for data that it needs to calculate the answer
Whatever you are trying to calculate, just leave that value of X


*For example, if you are trying to calculate birth / death rate and you want to know the birth/death rate, leave "Birth/Death rate" as x when it asks for a value*
*As another example, if you have the birth rate and want to calculate the ammount of births, leave Births/deaths as x and enter the value that you have for everything else*


## This program requires an algebra.js import to function. Make sure to "npm i algebra.js -s" before starting
